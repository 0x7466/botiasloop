# Agent Skills Specification

Source: https://agentskills.io/specification.md

This document defines the Agent Skills format used by botiasloop.

## Directory structure

A skill is a directory containing at minimum a `SKILL.md` file:

```
skill-name/
└── SKILL.md          # Required
```

Optionally include additional directories:
- `scripts/` - Executable code
- `references/` - Additional documentation
- `assets/` - Static resources (templates, data files)

## SKILL.md format

The `SKILL.md` file must contain YAML frontmatter followed by Markdown content.

### Frontmatter (required)

```yaml
---
name: skill-name
description: A description of what this skill does and when to use it.
---
```

With optional fields:

```yaml
---
name: pdf-processing
description: Extract text and tables from PDF files, fill forms, merge documents.
license: Apache-2.0
metadata:
  author: example-org
  version: "1.0"
---
```

### Field Reference

| Field           | Required | Constraints                                                                                                       |
| --------------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `name`          | Yes      | Max 64 characters. Lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens only. Must not start or end with a hyphen.             |
| `description`   | Yes      | Max 1024 characters. Non-empty. Describes what the skill does and when to use it.                                 |
| `license`       | No       | License name or reference to a bundled license file.                                                              |
| `compatibility` | No       | Max 500 characters. Indicates environment requirements. |
| `metadata`      | No       | Arbitrary key-value mapping for additional metadata.                                                              |
| `allowed-tools` | No       | Space-delimited list of pre-approved tools the skill may use. (Experimental)                                      |

### Name Field Rules

- Must be 1-64 characters
- May only contain lowercase alphanumeric characters and hyphens (`a-z` and `-`)
- Must not start or end with `-`
- Must not contain consecutive hyphens (`--`)
- Must match the parent directory name

Valid: `pdf-processing`, `data-analysis`, `code-review`
Invalid: `PDF-Processing` (uppercase), `-pdf` (leading hyphen), `pdf--processing` (consecutive hyphens)

### Body content

The Markdown body after the frontmatter contains the skill instructions. There are no format restrictions.

Recommended sections:
- Step-by-step instructions
- Examples of inputs and outputs
- Common edge cases

Keep under 500 lines. Move detailed content to `references/`.

## Progressive Disclosure

Skills are structured for efficient use of context:

1. **Metadata** (~100 tokens): The `name` and `description` fields are loaded at startup for all skills
2. **Instructions** (< 5000 tokens recommended): The full `SKILL.md` body is loaded when the skill is activated
3. **Resources** (as needed): Files in `scripts/`, `references/`, or `assets/` are loaded only when required

## File References

When referencing other files in your skill, use relative paths from the skill root:

```markdown
See [the reference guide](references/REFERENCE.md) for details.

Run the extraction script:
scripts/extract.py
```

Keep file references one level deep from `SKILL.md`. Avoid deeply nested reference chains.
